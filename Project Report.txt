Project Report: Flashcard Tutor

1. Introduction and Project Goal

The Flashcard Tutor project aimed to develop a functional, interactive, and highly customizable desktop application for self-quizzing and memory reinforcement. The primary goal was to create a data-driven tool using Python's standard library (tkinter for GUI) that allows users to load any subject material from a simple CSV file and track their progress through a simulated spaced repetition cycle.

2. Technical Architecture and Design

The application adheres to strong Object-Oriented Design (OOD) principles, structuring the program logic around three key classes:

2.1. Model Classes (Data and State Management)

Class

Responsibility

Key Attributes

Flashcard

Stores the immutable content of a single card and tracks its state.

question, answer, is_known (boolean)

quizdeck

Acts as the central data store, managing the collection of Flashcard objects.

cards (list of Flashcard objects)

The quizdeck class is responsible for file I/O (loading data from cards.csv) and data manipulation (shuffling the deck), isolating data logic from the presentation layer.

2.2. Controller/View Class (GUI and Flow)

Class

Responsibility

Key Attributes

F_App

Manages the Tkinter GUI components, handles user interaction (clicks and keys), updates state, and controls the flow of the quiz.

master (Tk root), deck, current_card_index, known_count

This separation ensures that data structure and GUI elements can be modified independently.

3. Implementation Details

3.1. CSV Data Handling and Error Management

The quizdeck.load_from_csv method implements essential checks to ensure application stability:

File Validation: Catches FileNotFoundError and prompts the user via a messagebox.

Header Parsing: Dynamically finds the indices of the Question and Answer columns, making the column order flexible.

Data Integrity: Skips malformed rows and ensures both question and answer fields are non-empty before creating a Flashcard object.

3.2. User Interface (Tkinter)

The interface utilizes a dark color scheme (#1e1e1e background, #2c3e50 card frame) for a modern, focused study environment.

Status Tracking: The status_label is updated in real-time by F_App.update_status(), displaying the current card number and the cumulative score of known cards.

State Control: The F_App.enable_evaluation_buttons() method is critical. It ensures that the "I KNEW IT" and "I MISSED IT" buttons are disabled until the user has clicked "REVEAL ANSWER", enforcing the required review sequence.

3.3. Keyboard Bindings

Efficiency was improved by implementing keyboard shortcuts, binding the main Tk root window to the <Key> event. This allows users to press 'R', 'Y', or 'N' to advance through the quiz without relying solely on the mouse.

4. Conclusion

The Flashcard Tutor successfully meets all stated project goals. It is a reliable, standalone Python application that effectively demonstrates proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming, GUI development with tkinter, robust file input/output, and the implementation of a simple state machine to manage the quiz flow. The project is highly modular and easily maintained due to its clear separation of data and presentation logic.
